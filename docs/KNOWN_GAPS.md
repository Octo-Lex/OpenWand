# OpenWand Known Gaps

Documented from disk-verified reconnaissance at Wave 40. Updated at Wave 50A.
Updated again at Wave 69G with halt-era blocker closures and current gaps.
Updated at Wave 118A: all gaps remain accurate through v0.9.0.

## Halt-Era Blocker Closures (69A–69E)

| # | Blocker | Closure Wave | Resolution |
|---|---------|-------------|------------|
| H1 | Filesystem sandbox escape — tools could resolve paths outside workspace | 69A | Centralized `resolve_workspace_path()` in `tools/src/sandbox.rs`; all local tools resolve through it |
| H2 | Approval workspace swap — approval resumption not bound to original workspace | 69B | `canonical_workspace` field on `ApprovalContextSnapshot`; fail-closed on None; canonical comparison before `tool.resumed` |
| H3 | Desktop compile failure — 13 files with design token name drift, missing imports | 69C | Fixed `COLORS::`→`colors::`, `TYPO::`→`typo::`, rsx! format-string patterns, `openwand_app::`→`crate::`, stale fixtures |
| H4 | Canonical fixture drift — eval test fixtures missing capability_context fields | 69C | Added 4 CC scenarios to `make_passing_report_set()`; updated required scenario count |
| H5 | Placeholder verification commands — `cmd_explain`, `cmd_trace_verify`, `cmd_session_rebuild` faked work | 69D | Exit non-zero with "not yet implemented"; +6 CLI integration tests |
| H6 | Mock/unknown production trace attribution — runner used "mock"/"unknown" in production path | 69E | `TraceIdentity` struct derives real provider/model from `RunConfig.llm_target`; "unavailable" when not configured |

**All halt-era blockers resolved.**

## Current Gaps (Updated Wave 90B — post-v0.4.0 stable)

| # | Gap | Category | Status |
|---|-----|----------|--------|
| C1 | ~~9 placeholder UI surfaces (3-line stubs)~~ | Feature | ✅ Closed 80A-80C — all 10 surfaces implemented |
| C2 | `openwand-app` 50 test-module clippy warnings | Cosmetic | Accepted (DEFERRED-001) — grew from 43 in 86B due to new waves |
| C3 | `openwand-content` crate is a stub (add() only) | Feature | Accepted — README corrected 83A |
| C4 | Trace store append-only is structural, not enforced by runtime verifier | Architecture | Accepted (claim corrected in README) |
| C5 | 15 cargo audit warnings (all transitive, via Dioxus/Loro) | Dependency | Accepted (DEFERRED-002) — 0 vulnerabilities, verified 82A |
| C6 | ~~23 commits ahead of origin/master~~ | Publication | ✅ Resolved — all published to remote |
| C7 | ~~No concurrent mutation tests~~ | Testing | ✅ Closed 69G |
| C8 | ~~69F workspace --all-targets regression~~ | Build | ✅ Closed 70B |
| C9 | ~~Workflow UI surfaces are static, not wired to live data~~ | Feature | ✅ Closed 84A-84C — 5 surfaces live-wired |
| C10 | ~~Non-Windows platform validation deferred~~ | Validation | ✅ Partially closed 85A — Linux compilation validated, GUI runtime deferred |
| C11 | ~~Unix sandbox not tested on Linux~~ | Validation | ✅ Closed 85A — 3,934 tests on Linux, 0 failures |
| C12 | macOS compilation/runtime not validated | Validation | Accepted — no macOS environment available |

## v0.4.0 New Items

| # | Gap | Category | Status |
|---|-----|----------|--------|
| C13 | ARID/tool-call-ID mismatch in 88B approval | Precision | Accepted — runner recovery index resolves it; refinement deferred |
